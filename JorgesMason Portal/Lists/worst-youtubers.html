        <h2>Mr Beast</h2>

        <img src="imges/mr-beast.jpg" alt="mr-beast" class="pics">

        <p>Mr Beast is most definitely a sham. At least I think he is! He makes the same content over and over again <i>"last one to leave the circle wins $10,000 dollars!"</i> 
           or <i>"Last to take their hand off of this private jet gets to take it home!"</i> Like bro it gets old and he just reuses those 2 video ideas. Also think about this. His name is <b>Mr Beast.</b>
           What do Beasts do? they prey on inferior species. Who is Mr Beast's demographic? Young Children and teenagers.... PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER!!! (im kidding i just dislike his content)

        <h2>xQc</h2>

        <img src="imges/XqC.jpg" alt="xQc" class="pics">

        <p>this man is just downright boring. I can't even possibly fathom how you could ever sit down and find this man entertaining. I tried watching his content once and I can't say it was all bad. 
            It helped me fall asleep.

        <h2>Ishowspeed</h2>

        <img src="imges/ishowspeed.jpg" alt="ishowspeed" class="pics">

        <p>Content is cancerous. I lost numerous brain cells watching this man. His gay jokes and loud demeanor is not funny. How is this man famous?</p>

        <h2>Jake Paul</h2>

        <img src="imges/jake-paul.jpg" alt="jake-paul" class="pics">

        <p>I don't even have to give a descripton for this one. Grown man fighiting for clout. Unbelievable.</p>

    <section class="section-dark">
        <h2>Logan Paul</h2>

        <img src="imges/logan-paul.jpg" alt="logan-paul" class="pics">

        <p>His brother too. He's the just about the same too. They are both incredilby kiddsh minded adults. I also can not withstand his arrogance. And he recorded a the Japnese suicide in the woods (Something like that)</p>

    <section class="section-light">
        <h2>Keemstar</h2>

        <img src="imges/keemstar.jpg" alt="keemstar" class="pics">

        <p>THIS MAN IS AWUFUL! I would definitely say he is the worst on the list so far! He has instigated mutltiple youtube dramas, exacerbated the mental health of Etika (which led him to suicide), and many more instances I can't think of off the top of my head</p>

        <h2>Filthy Frank</h2>

        <img src="imges/filthy-frank.webp" alt="filthy-frank" class="pics">

        <p>EWWWWW this man was just flat out weird. I never understood the hype around this man. I guess his content was just at it's peak in the early 2010's. I didn't watch it growing up. But now that I did.. IT'S BAD. Who in their right mind finds amusmnet from a 
            grown man wearing a tight pink suit? Alongside with that him doing weird things with other guys.....odd.
